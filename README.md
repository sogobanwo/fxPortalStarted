# Building with Polygon Bridge
### Project Overview
This project involves deploying an NFT collection on the Ethereum blockchain, mapping the collection to Polygon, and transferring assets over via the Polygon Bridge. To add a creative twist, image generation tools like DALLE 2 or Midjourney will be used to generate the images for the NFTs.

### Tools Used
- Hardhat
- Foundry (optional)
- DALLE 2 or Midjourney for image generation
- Pinata.cloud for IPFS storage
- Polygon Bridge for asset transfer
- Project Rubric

### Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:
- Set up a Hardhat project and install the required dependencies.
- Generate a collection of 5 images using DALLE 2 or Midjourney.
- Store the images on IPFS using Pinata.cloud.
- Deploy an ERC721 or ERC1155 contract on the Goerli Ethereum Testnet.
- Implement the promptDescription function on the contract.
- Map the NFT collection using the Polygon network token mapper (optional).
- Write Hardhat scripts for batch minting and transferring NFTs.
- Test the project by approving, depositing, and verifying the transfer of NFTs on the Mumbai testnet.

Good luck with your project!
